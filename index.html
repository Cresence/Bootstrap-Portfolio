      <p>My name is as stated above, Devon Harris, and this is just giving a little bit of a glimpse into who I am and my prerogative.</p>

      <p>Over the past few years, I’ve transitioned from my previous role of being a certified medical assistant, into a handyman role of wearing multiple hats as a “Director of Quality Assurance”, and now I've been preparing myself to transition into a Full Stack Developer.</p>

      <p>I aim to combine my accumulated work ethic into my always present interest in technology. Here's a saying, perhaps a goal, through whatever I do, I hope to aspire. "To obtain opportunities to gain knowledge and experience in servicing any occupation within my best capabilities or beyond."</p>
